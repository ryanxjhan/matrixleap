Matrix Leap proudly introduces WheelSelect Pro, a cutting-edge solution designed to revolutionize the wheelset selection process in railway maintenance. This project involves the development of upper computer software and a companion handheld application, aiming to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and convenience in wheelset management. WheelSelect Pro is a testament to our commitment to driving innovation in the transportation sector.

## Technical Overview

The core of WheelSelect Pro lies in its robust and user-friendly software, developed using Visual Studio 2022 and C# for the upper machine, and Android Studio and Java for the handheld device. The system employs MySQL 8.0 databases to manage extensive data involved in wheelset selection and storage. Designed to work with Windows 7 and above, as well as Android 7.0 and above, the software ensures wide compatibility and reliability. The hardware setup includes servers for data handling and PDAs for on-the-go operations, emphasizing redundancy and efficiency.

## Client Impact

Implementing WheelSelect Pro has significantly streamlined our client's wheelset selection process, leading to improved operational efficiency and reduced human errors. The seamless integration of the upper computer software with the handheld application allows for real-time data exchange and decision-making, enhancing the overall workflow. The ability to generate and print barcodes directly at the point of action has markedly improved the accuracy and speed of inventory management. Our client reports substantial time savings and cost reductions, attributing these improvements to the comprehensive and intuitive nature of WheelSelect Pro.

## Final Note

Details of the project are kept generalized to respect the confidentiality agreements and protect the interests of our client. Matrix Leap remains dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technological innovation while prioritizing the security and competitive advantage of our clients.
